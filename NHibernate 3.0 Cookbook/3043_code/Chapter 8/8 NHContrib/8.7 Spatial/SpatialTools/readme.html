<h1>SQL Spatial Query Visualizer</h1>
for Microsoft SQL Server 2008


<h2>Tips'n'tricks</h2>

<h3>Colors</h3>
<p>
Control the output colors by creating FillColor and LineColor columns.
</p>
Examples:
<pre>
	SELECT *, 'Green' AS FillColor, 'Transparent' as LineColor FROM countries   <i>-- Green fill, no outline</i>
	SELECT *, '#FF49A9CC' AS FillColor FROM countries    <i>-- Hex-value based fill color, Default outline (Black)</i>
</pre>
<p>
If your color is integral, it will map the color to a rainbow-like scale using values from 0..16777216.<br/>
If you color is floating point, it will map the color to a rainbow-like scale using values from 0..1.<br/>
Values outside this range will be clipped.
</p>
Example:<br/>
	<img src="Example2.jpg" /><br/>
<p>
	If the color cannot be parsed it will use default colors (Black for outline, White for fill).
</p>


<h3>Lines</h3>
<p>
	Control the thickness of lines/outlines by creating a LineThickness column. The value specifies the width in pixels.
</p>
Example:
<pre>
	SELECT *, 'Blue' as LineColor, 3 as LineThickness FROM Rivers
</pre>

<h3>Points</h3>
<p>
	Points are currently not supported for display, but you can use STBuffer() to make the points into buffer-polygons.
</p>
Examples:
<pre>
	SELECT geom.STBuffer(1), * FROM cities
	SELECT geom.STBuffer(POPULATION), * FROM cities; <i>-- Large city => large circle</i>
</pre>

<h3>Lines in spherical geometry</h3>
<p>If you use the geography type or a geometry type with an SRID between 4000 and 4999, lines will be shown as curves following a great circle. This doesn't mean that the lines are not straight - Just that projecting a sphere onto a flat screen distorts straight lines into curves (<a href="http://www.sharpgis.net/2008/01/12/StraightLinesOnASphere.aspx">see more here</a>). If they cross the dateline, they will also be cut in two (see below).<br/>
Note that this curvature is not applied to polygons, so you might see some discrepancies on large polygons with few vertices.</p>

<h3>Background Map</h3>
<p>
If you use a geometry type with an SRID between 4000 and 4999 (which is assumed to contain longitude/latitude coordinate pairs) or a Geography type, a rough world map is shown as background. You can disable this in View menu.
You can also specify your own world map to use. The image has to be a map in the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_carr%C3%A9e_projection">Plate Carrée</a>" projection containing the entire world. Width should be twice the size of the height.
</p>
<p>
You can get a good satellite image as background from here: <a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=7105">http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=7105</a> (I've had good success with the 5400x2700 JPEG image, but beware that larger images could cause problems).
</p>

<h3>Export result as ShapeFile</h3>
<p>
	This feature is very beta. Most datatypes are converted to strings and Z and M values are stripped.<br />
</p>
<p>
	Note that if you a mix of points, multipoints, lines and polygons in your resultset, up to four sets of shapefiles will be created.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
	Countries sharing border with Switzerland<br/>
	<img src="Example1.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
	Spatial join: Countries that contain the worlds 10 largest cities<br/>
	<img src="Example3.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
	Area within 100km of Denmark<br/>
	<img src="Example4.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
	Merging multiple queries to generate a combined map<br/>
